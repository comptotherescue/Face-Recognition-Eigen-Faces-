# Face-Recognition-Eigen-Faces-

Humans have spatial as well as temporal memory. Our visual sensors perceive the data and transmit it over neurons so that we could 
remember it. Although what we perceive has some memory bound and happen to obliterate over time. We often distinguish a person by 
his/her features. As our glance projects to human face,we separate people by genders,eyes,expressions,facial muscles etc.A system,
thus,can be implemented to recognize people from one another.The image sent to the system is human face and hence driven through 
series of tests consisting threshold calculation,histogram plotting,error introduction.
The Proposed System increases the efﬁciency to get the information of a human face whose recordisal ready available.
The image then compared with the one stored in database and hence described upon the suitable match.
Such system with an inclination towards higher accuracy may yield great opportunities in the ﬁeld of criminal detection,
airportsecuritysystem,facerecognition vaults,attendance system.

Implemented an adaptive face recognition system. Used a technique called Eigen faces to make vectors of faces. A new image is transformed into a vector and is compared with the existing vectors. If match is not found, this new image is trained along with its information in the system.
